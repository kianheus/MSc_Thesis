# Main Overview

This repository contains the code that I (KIan Heus) used and wrote during my thesis. During this thesis, I researched the possibility of using an Autoencoder machine learning framework to approximate decoupling coordinates for underactuated mechanical systems. Different directories with a short description are provided below. Directories marked as (WIP) are work-in-progress, with code and markdown changes planned to improve readability.


## Important directories
1. **Kian_code/Mathematica**. This directory contains analytic computations which support findings and proofs used in the thesis. (WIP)

2. Mechanical systems:\
    2.a. **Kian_code/Double_Pendulum**. This directory contains code for dynamics simulation and coordinate learning of the single-mass double pendulum system. (WIP)\
    2.b. **Kian_code/Series_Elastic_Actuator**. This directory contains similar code, for the series-elastic actuator system. (WIP)

3. **Kian_code/Controllers**. This directory contains multiple controllers with built-in simulation for the single-mass double pendulum, along with results. (WIP)

4. **Plotting**. This directory contains plotter files and simulation results. (WIP)


P.S. \
The code was originally forked from the assignment code for the Robotics course Intelligent Control Systems (ICS) of the TU Delft, but in the end I wrote my own simulations.
